- Write cliw script
  - cliWrapper task
  - checkCliWrapper task?
  - Eventually, cliw.bat
- Configuration with a "cli" extension
- Should be able to run a Java/JVM main from in a project's source via cliw
- Can depend on tasks and run those tasks beforehand (e.g. for making sure a Java source is compiled)
- Should be able to run a Java/JVM main from buildSrc via cliw
- Also from a plugin
  - Document the correct way to add this relationship
- Arguments from the command line should be passed along correctly
- Interactive CLIs should work correctly
- Pipes to standard input should work correctly
- Option to suppress output from Gradle (unless it fails), so
- Allow other plugins or libraries to add additional types of CLIs and how to run them (i.e. CLIs in other languages)
  - Probably also include a default "just configure an exec call" type
